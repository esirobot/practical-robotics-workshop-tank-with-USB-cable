This folder contains a number of Snap! example programs. They are:

SimpleRemoteControl - Controls the Finch with the arrow keys and r, g, b.
BetterFinchControl - Also controls Finch with arrow keys and r, g, and b, but the program is more complex, allowing much finer control. You can mix the LED colors, and have the Finch move in arcs as well as turning in place or straight lines.
FinchDance - The Finch moves around and changes its beak color.
SimpleLightFollower - The Finch follows light. This version of a light follower is a very simple but effective implementation that directly links the light sensor readings through a scalar to the motor speeds.
LightFollower1 - Alternative implementation of a light follower that uses conditions to determine if it should turn or go straight.
ObstacleAvoider - Avoids obstacles; note that the obstacle sensors on Finch are best able to detect large, white or lightly-colored obstacles like paper or cardboard boxes.
FinchSimonSays - A Simon Says game for Finch; the user is commanded to place the robot in a certain orientation - if they make it, they get a point. The game gets harder with each point earned.
FinchGestureProgrammer - Press the 'r' key and program the Finch by setting it in a number of orientations - Beak Up for forward, Beak Down for backward, Left Wing Down for left, Right Wing Down for right. Hit space to end recording, then put the Finch on the floor, hit 'p', and watch the Finch move according to how you programmed it.
FinchPong - Move the paddle by rolling the Finch, try not to miss! The game gets harder as time progresses.
SimpleFinch - This one explores custom blocks; we've hidden almost all of the blocks and exposed just a few custom blocks that move the Finch, change it's color, and make it beep (in the motion, looks, and sound category). This interface is meant for very young kids to start with.
Asteroids Game - Contributed by Sean Stern, turn the Finch into a controller to play a version of the 80s Arcade classic, Asteroids. Comes with a starter file and a lab, as well as a solution.
